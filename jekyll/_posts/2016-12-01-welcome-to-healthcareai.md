Health Catalyst’s data science team is excited to present [healthcare.ai](http://healthcare.ai). This ambitious new project offers healthcare-specific machine learning packages, as well as analysis, commentary, and advice on leveraging machine learning within any health system, regardless of size.

While companies like [Google](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/healthcare/), [Microsoft](http://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/opinion/Microsoft-Project-Adam-may-reach-healthcare-specialties), and [IBM](https://www.mskcc.org/about/innovative-collaborations/watson-oncology) are doing machine learning on the outskirts of healthcare, we work from the center. We bring practical, accurate predictive models to health systems interested in improving their operational, financial, and clinical efficiencies. First and foremost, we want to improve patient outcomes.

Machine learning has been used in other industries for years, but healthcare is late to the game. We want to change this. Considering the enormous amount of data in EMRs, the impressive ability of machine learning to detect complex patterns, and the thousands of [lives at risk](http://journals.lww.com/journalpatientsafety/Fulltext/2013/09000/A_New,_Evidence_based_Estimate_of_Patient_Harms.2.aspx) in hospitals each day, it's imperative to help healthcare organizations use data to make better decisions.

Instead of health systems hiring expensive data scientists to do this work, we want to help anyone interested in healthcare data—BI Developers and SQL-based folks in particular—develop machine learning skills (via R or Python).

We'll share more details about healthcare.ai in the coming weeks, but here's a snapshot of what it encompasses:

- A healthcare-specific R machine learning package
- A healthcare-specific Python machine learning package
- Guidance on where and how to apply machine learning in healthcare
- Analysis on outcomes improvement via CAFE, the largest healthcare dataset ever compiled

To get started with healthcare machine learning now, see [healthcare.ai](http://healthcare.ai) for R and Python.
